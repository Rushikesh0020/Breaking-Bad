**Breaking Bad : A Short Summary on One of My Favorite TV Series**
   * Be it the transformation from high school chemistry teacher Walter White to the drug kingpin Heisenberg, or his accomplice and former student Jesse Pinkman transforming from a low-level street drug dealer to working under cartels, Breaking Bad progresses and develops its characters in a terrific way. Googling anything related to Breaking Bad would yield image results of Cranston’s character in his iconic and fierce-looking French cut beard and shaved head, but in the first season, he’s just your average looking middle-class family man wearing bright coloured clothes. Over the seasons, he develops a menacing personality as money slowly takes over him and he starts distancing himself from his family to focus more on his skills as a methamphetamine manufacturer. By the end of the second season, he is a distant shadow of his former self and by the time the series ends he becomes a totally different person (literally and figuratively). Jesse Pinkman, DEA Agent/ASAC Shrader and even his family develop in various ways in response to the events that take their life by storm. 
   * A number of shows earn so much critical acclaim during their initial seasons that they just tend to ride on that success and forget about delivering a satisfying conclusion that fans seek. (*cough Game of Thrones *cough*). Breaking Bad not only delivers a powerful ultimate episode, but it also delivers equally amazing antepenultimate and penultimate episodes. Its antepenultimate episode “Ozymandias”, is regarded as the greatest episode in TV history, and has won multiple Emmy awards while maintaining a solid 10/10 rating on IMDb. The final episode “Felina” is again, widely hailed as the greatest conclusion to any TV series ever as it draws the series to a fitting conclusion to the tunes of Badfinger.
